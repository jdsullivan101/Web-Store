This is a basic webstore implementation for Web Application development module at Atlantic Technological University (ATU). The code utilises Javascript, Node, HTML and Bootstrap using CDN. The application requires a database connection that should be set up prior to 
testing this code. The username, password can be found in the index.js file. This will also be displayed on a terminal/console when the application is started. On launch the application is connected to the localhost port at port 3000, and can be used from there.\
It's a basic implementation where a user can add items to their basket, which is stored locally in the browser cache. Upon navigating to the checkout page, the storage is iterated over and each of the added items is pulled to show the cost to the user.
The application utilises features of the Bootstrap CDN such as carousel images.
